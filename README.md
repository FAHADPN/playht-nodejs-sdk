The PlayHT SDK provides easy to use methods to wrap the [PlayHT API](https://docs.play.ht/reference/api-getting-started).

# Installation

This module is distributed via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and
should be installed as one of your project's dependencies:

```shell
npm install --save playht
```

or for installation with [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager:

```shell
yarn add playht
```

# Usage

Before using the SDK, you need to generate an API Secret Key and obtain your User ID. If you already have a PlayHT account, navigate to the [API access page](https://play.ht/studio/api-access). For more details [see the API documentation](https://docs.play.ht/reference/api-authentication#generating-your-api-secret-key-and-obtaining-your-user-id).

Import methods from the library and call `init()` with your credentials to set up the SDK:

```javascript
import * as PlayHT from 'playht';

PlayHT.init({
  apiKey: '<YOUR API KEY>',
  userId: '<YOUR API KEY>',
});
```

_**Important:** Keep your API Secret Key confidential. Do not share it with anyone or include it in publicly accessible code repositories._

## Generating Speech

To get an URL with the audio for a generated file using the default settings, call the `generateSpeech()` method with the text you wish to convert.

```javascript
import * as PlayHT from 'playht';

// Generate audio from text
const generated = await PlayHT.generateSpeech('Computers can speak now!');

// Grab the generated file URL
const { audioUrl } = generated;

console.log('The url for the audio file is', audioUrl);
```

The output also contains a `generationId` field and an optional `message` field. `generationId` is a unique identifier for the generation request, which can be used for tracking and referencing the specific generation job. The optional `message` field gives additional information about the generation such as status or error messages.

For more speech generation options, see [Generating Speech Options](#generating-speech-options) below.

## Streaming Speech

The `streamSpeech()` method streams audio from text. It returns a readable stream where the audio bytes will flow to as soon as they're ready. For example, to use the default settings to convert text into a audio stream and write it into a file:

```javascript
import * as PlayHT from 'playht';
import fs from 'fs';

// Create a file stream
const fileStream = fs.createWriteStream('hello-playht.mp3');

// Stream audio from text
const stream = await PlayHT.streamSpeech('This sounds very realistic.');

// Pipe stream into file
stream.pipe(fileStream);
```

For more speech generation options, see [Generating Speech Options](#generating-speech-options) below.

**_Note: For lowest possible latency, use the streaming API with a PlayHT 2.0 voice._**

## Streaming Speech From Input Stream

The `streamSpeechFromInputStream()` method allows you to stream audio from a text stream input. It returns a readable stream where the audio bytes will flow to. For example, to convert a text stream into an audio file using the default settings:

```javascript
import * as PlayHT from 'playht';
import { Readable } from 'stream';
import fs from 'fs';

// Create a test stream
const textStream = new Readable({
  read() {
    this.push('You can stream');
    this.push('text right into');
    this.push('an audio stream!');
    this.push(null); // End of data
  },
});

// Stream audio from text
const stream = await PlayHT.streamSpeechFromInputStream(textStream, {
  voiceEngine: 'PlayHT1.0',
  voiceId: 'larry',
});

// Create a file stream
const fileStream = fs.createWriteStream('hello-playht.mp3');
stream.pipe(fileStream);
```

For a full example of using the streaming speech from input stream API, see our [ChatGPT Integration Example](chatgpt-integration-example) below.

For more speech generation options, see [Generating Speech Options](#generating-speech-options) below.

## Generating Speech Options

All text-to-speech methods above accept an optional `options` parameter. You can use it to generate audio with different voices, AI models, output file formats and much more.

The options available will depend on the AI model that synthesize the selected voice. PlayHT API supports 3 different types of models: 'PlayHT2.0', 'PlayHT1.0' and 'Standard'. For all available options, see the typescript type definitions [in the code](packages/playht/src/index.ts).

### PlayHT 2.0 Voices

Our newest voice generation AI model enhanced from 1.0 with added emotion direction speech generation and instant cloning. English Only.

The voice ids for these voices will look like urls.

To generate an audio file using a PlayHT 2.0 voice with emotion and other options:

```javascript
import * as PlayHT from 'playht';

const text = 'Am I a conversational voice with options?';

// Generate audio from text
const generated = await PlayHT.generateSpeech(text, {
  voiceEngine: 'PlayHT2.0',
  voiceId: 's3://peregrine-voices/oliver_narrative2_parrot_saad/manifest.json',
  outputFormat: 'mp3',
  temperature: 1.5,
  quality: 'high',
  speed: 0.8,
  emotion: 'fearful',
  styleGuidance: 16,
});

// Grab the generated file URL
const { audioUrl } = generated;

console.log('The url for the audio file is', audioUrl);
```

### PlayHT 1.0 Voices

Lifelike voices ideal for expressive and conversational content. English Only.

To generate audio with a PlayHT 1.0 voice:

```javascript
import * as PlayHT from 'playht';

const text = 'Options are never enough.';

// Generate audio from text
const generated = await PlayHT.generateSpeech(text, {
  voiceEngine: 'PlayHT1.0',
  voiceId: 'susan',
  outputFormat: 'wav',
  temperature: 0.5,
  quality: 'medium',
  seed: 11,
});

// Grab the generated file URL
const { audioUrl } = generated;

console.log('The url for the audio file is', audioUrl);
```

### Standard Voices

For multi-lingual text-to speech generations, changing pitches, and adding pauses. Voices with reliable outputs and support for Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML). Supports 100+ Languages.

And an example with standard voice in Spanish:

```javascript
import * as PlayHT from 'playht';

const text = 'La inteligencia artificial puede hablar espa√±ol.';

// Generate audio from text
const generated = await PlayHT.generateSpeech(text, {
  voiceEngine: 'Standard',
  voiceId: 'Mia',
  quality: 'low',
  speed: 1.2,
});

// Grab the generated file URL
const { audioUrl } = generated;

console.log('The url for the audio file is', audioUrl);
```

For a full list of available voices and the languages they speak, see [Listing Available Voices](#listing-available-voices)

## Listing Available Voices

To list all available voices in our platform, including voices you cloned, you can call the `listVoices()` method with no parameters:

```javascript
import * as PlayHT from 'playht';

// Fetch all available voices
const voices = await PlayHT.listVoices();

// Output them to the console.
console.log(JSON.stringify(voices, null, 2));
```

The `listVoices()` method also takes in an optional parameter to filter the voices by different fields. To get all stock female PlayHT 2.0 voices:

```javascript
import * as PlayHT from 'playht';

// Fetch stock female PlayHT 2.0 voices
const voices = await PlayHT.listVoices({
  gender: 'female',
  voiceEngine: ['PlayHT2.0'],
  isCloned: false,
});

// Output them to the console.
console.log(JSON.stringify(voices, null, 2));
```

## Instant Clone a Voice

You can use the `instantCloneFromFile()` to create a cloned voice from audio data. The cloned voice is ready to be used straight away.

```javascript
import * as PlayHT from 'playht';
import fs from 'fs';

// Load an audio file
const fileBlob = fs.readFileSync('voice-to-clone.mp3');

// Clone the voice
const clonedVoice = await PlayHT.instantCloneFromFile('dolly', fileBlob, 'male');

// Display the cloned voice information in the console
console.log('Cloned voice info\n', JSON.stringify(clonedVoice, null, 2));

// Use the cloned voice straight away to generate an audio file
const fileStream = fs.createWriteStream('hello-dolly.mp3');
const stream = await PlayHT.streamSpeech('Cloned voices sound realistic too.', {
  voiceEngine: clonedVoice.voiceEngine,
  voiceId: clonedVoice.id,
});
stream.pipe(fileStream);
```

# SDK Examples
